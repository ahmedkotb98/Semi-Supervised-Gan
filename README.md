# Semi-supervised GAN

This is an implementation of Semi-supervised generative adversarial network for fashion-mnist dataset.

## Training
 
You can use `python ImprovedGAN.py --cuda` to run it on GPU

## Results

after training you can achieve an accuracy higer than 90% on test dataset with 100 labeled data(10 per class) and other 59,000 unlabeled data after 200 epochs.
